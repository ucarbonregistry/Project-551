Type and Scope of RoU Project
Activity
Type Scope 5: Conservation measures taken to recycle
and/or reuse water, spent wash, wastewater etc. across
or within specific industrial processes and systems,
including wastewater recycled/ reused in a different
process, but within the same site or location of the
project activity. Recycled wastewater used in off-site
landscaping, gardening or tree plantations/forests
activity are also eligible under this Scope. 
________________
The project participant, Mangalam Common Effluent Recycling Technologies India Pvt Ltd, operates a
vertically integrated Common Effluent Treatment Plant with a capacity of 3.6 MLD. The project activity
started its operations from June 2013. The project is 0.5 km from Noyyal River, the total area required
for the project is approximately 3.25 acres. The Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) consists of Primary
treatment, biological treatment and Reverse osmosis (R.O) to treat the textile effluents and is designed
for Zero liquid discharge with an aim to treat dyeing and bleaching effluents arising from its 13 member
units. 

The project consists of the development of a 3.6 MLD Common Effluent treatment plant, aiming to
significantly reduce reliance on freshwater resources. In the absence of the initiative taken by Mangalam
Common Effluent Recycling Technologies India Pvt Ltd water would have sourced through groundwater
extraction to meet, exacerbating the already critical issue of water scarcity in India. With urban and
industrial sectors generating over 72,368 million liters of wastewater daily, only 28% of which is
currently treated3
, the challenge of wastewater management remains a pressing concern4
. The baseline
scenario involved the discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater, leading to groundwater depletion and environmental pollution. However, through the advanced treatment processes implemented—including Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO)
systems, the project now ensures the recycling and reuse of water, reducing the dependency on
groundwater and promoting a sustainable water management approach.
